::  migrations: agent state versions
::
::  Deliberately empty of migration machinery. The runtime's core
::  data structures are still moving too fast for migrations to be
::  worth their weight — on a breaking state change, nuke the agent
::  and start fresh at %0. Real migrations begin once the core
::  structures stabilize (see ratchet.md).

::  state-0: the full state of the grubbery agent.

::  Each field is one of three kinds. Truth fields are the namespace
::  itself and cannot be regenerated. Derived fields can be rebuilt
::  from the truth fields. Live fields are runtime state and also
::  cannot be regenerated.
